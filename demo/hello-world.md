The obligatory "Hello World" post.

Besides regular Markdown stuff like...

## Headings

And lists:

* Oranges
* Apples
* Bananas

[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) also provides a few more features...

Things like task lists:

* [ ] Oranges
* [x] Apples
* [ ] Bananas

Tables:

Fruit | Check
----- | -----
Oranges |
Apples | :heavy_check_mark:
Bananas |

And code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```JavaScript
function check(fruit) {
  list[fruit] = true;
}
```

Also, sparkles.
